## About
This project was a brief 1-week sprint where our team tried to complete an MVP for an [Open Austin](https://www.open-austin.org/) project

### What does the app do? 
    * What problem does it solve? Who uses it?
    * Why was it built?
    * User Inputs and Outputs

## Technologies

## SetUp and Requirements
* TODO: What is required to run this app. IE: MySQL, docker, etc

## Scripts
* TODO: What is required to run this app. IE: MySQL, docker, etc
  
## How to Use?
    * What happens behind the scenes when the user interacts with it? 
    * OR What are all the place the data travels?  What happens to that data?
    * Optionally include a diagram
    * How does the tech stack come together?

## Challenges

## Workflow
    * Your git workflow, style guides, commit guides, etc
    * What did you learn from the process
    * What were key takeaways from stand ups, code reviews, etc
    * Writing tests
    * Link to your trello board, discuss completed tickets

## Future Updates?
    * Future refactoring?
    * Additional dev ops considerations?
    * UI/UX additions?
